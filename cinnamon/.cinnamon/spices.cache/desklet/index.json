It begins on the vernal equinox as determined by astronomical calculations for the Iran Standard Time meridian (52.5&deg;E or GMT+3.5h). This determination of starting moment is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar as far as predicting the date of the vernal equinox is concerned because it uses astronomical calculation rather than mathematical rules. but requires consulting an astronomical almanac.<\/div>\n<div>\n &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div>\n <h3 style=\"margin: 30px 0px 20px;
